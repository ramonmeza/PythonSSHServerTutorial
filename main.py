    # How to Generate your SSH keys
    #
    # Linux:
    # use the command `ssh-keygen -A` in terminal 
    # to generate all of your SSH keys. Once the command is run,
    # you can find the RSA key in the following location: ~/.ssh/id_rsa, or /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa
    #
    # Windows 10:
    # Press Windows Key, type 'Manage Optional Features`. If OpenSSH Client & Server is in the list, you're all set.
    # If either is not, click on "Add a feature" and search for `OpenSSH`, click on them to install.
    # Next, open cmd as administrator. Enter the command `ssh-keygen` and follow the on screen prompts.
    # The location of the key will be displayed. Copy that and paste the location here.
    # If you put a password, include it as the second parameter, otherwise don't include it.
    server = SshServer(os.path.expanduser('~/.ssh/id_rsa'))

    # Start the server, you can give it a custom IP address and port, or
    # leave it empty to run on 127.0.0.1:22
    server.start("0.0.0.0", int(os.getenv("SSH_PORT", 22)))
